# TypeScript Object Types
TypeScript has a specific syntax for typing objects.  
Read more about objects in [JavaScript Objects chapter](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_objects.asp).  

Example  
```typescript
const car: { type: string, model: string, year: number } = {
  type: "Toyota",
  model: "Corolla",
  year: 2009
};
```  

Object types like this can also be written separately, and even be reused, look at interfaces for more details.  

## Type Inference
TypeScript can infer the types of properties based on their values.  

Example  
```typescript
const car = {
  type: "Toyota",
};
car.type = "Ford"; // no error
car.type = 2; // Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
```  

## Optional Properties
Optional properties are properties that don't have to be defined in the object definition.  

Example without an optional property  
```typescript
const car: { type: string, mileage: number } = { // Error: Property 'mileage' is missing in type '{ type: string; }' but required in type '{ type: string; mileage: number; }'.
  type: "Toyota",
};
car.mileage = 2000;
```  

Example with an optional property  
```typescript
const car: { type: string, mileage?: number } = { // no error
  type: "Toyota"
};
car.mileage = 2000;
```  

## Index Signatures
Index signatures can be used for objects without a defined list of properties.  

Example
```typescript
const nameAgeMap: { [index: string]: number } = {};
nameAgeMap.Jack = 25; // no error
nameAgeMap.Mark = "Fifty"; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
```  

Index signatures like this one can also be expressed with utility types like `Record<string, number>`.  
More about utility types like this in a later chapter.
